## Project Context
5starmemo - A spaced repetition learning system with mobile app and web dashboard.

## Development Guidelines
We are early in development. When we are debugging a solution, do not add needless fail-safes. We want to avoid adding too much bloat and leftover junk which we won't be able to find, maintain or clean-up.
